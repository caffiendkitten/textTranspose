# testTranspose
You will be given an array that contains two strings. Your job is to create a function that will take those two strings and transpose them, so that the strings go from top to bottom instead of left to right.


Example: <br>
transposeTwoStrings(['Hello','World']);

should return:<br>
H W  <br>
e o  <br>
l r  <br>
l l  <br>
o d
